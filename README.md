MusicXML and MEI conversion
---------------------------

Python scripts that convert xml files encoded in MusicXML format to MEI (Music Encoding Initiative), and back. 
As the structure of these files can be quite complex and there are many different elements and relationships to account for, only a subset of elements are translated between the file formats.

Dependencies
------------

* lxml
* pymei - libmei python bindings (http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/libmei)
